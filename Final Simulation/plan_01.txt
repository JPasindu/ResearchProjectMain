1. set train and test indexes
2. Generate a dataset
2. Get 0_proportion(p0), k_proportion(pk), other values proportion and unique_value count <--- **
3. train and test split
4. y_mean, y_std, R_2_hat, p0_nb, pk_nb(use train only)
5. R_2_hat<0 (keep all the values as null -> break the process)
6. fit models
    1. stat models
    output:- log-likelihood(training only)
          :- AIC/BIC(training only)
          :- MSE/MAE/R^2(testing and training(to check the overfitting))
          :- accuraces of 3 classes(0, k, other counts)
    2. ML models
    output:- MSE/MAE/R^2(testing and training(to check the overfitting))
          :- accuraces of 3 classes(0, k, other counts)
